# Intelligent Study & Research Assistant 🧠✨

**A comprehensive "Operating System" for Engineering Students featuring an infinite workspace, smart scheduling, and AI research tools.**

## 📋 Overview
This project is a functional web-based productivity platform designed to solve the fragmented workflow of engineering students. Instead of switching between PDF readers, calendar apps, and note-taking tools, this application unifies them into a single **Infinite Canvas**.

Currently in **Public Beta**, the system allows users to organize complex research, manage deadlines dynamically, and query offline textbooks using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

## 🚀 Key Features
### 1. The Infinite Study Canvas 🎨
* **Non-Linear Note Taking:** A drag-and-drop workspace where users can place PDFs, images, and text notes anywhere.
* **Spatial Organization:** Group related concepts visually (e.g., "Math 3 Complex Analysis" cluster).

### 2. Dynamic Engineering Calendar 📅
* **Smart Scheduling:** Integrates deadlines directly with study materials.
* **Time-Blocking:** Drag tasks from the canvas directly onto the calendar timeline.

### 3. AI Research Agent (RAG Pipeline) 🤖
* **Offline Knowledge Base:** "Chat" with uploaded engineering textbooks without needing internet access for the core data.
* **Formula Extraction:** Automatically identifies and parses LaTeX equations from PDF scans.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Vue.js (Vue 3, Composition API)
* **State Management:** Pinia (for handling complex canvas state)
* **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS + Custom Canvas Logic
* **Backend (AI):** Python, LangChain, OpenAI API
* **Database:** ChromaDB (Vector Store for RAG)
